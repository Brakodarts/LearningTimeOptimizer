PROJECT: Learning Path Optimizer
GOAL: Create an algorithm that schedules learning tasks based on priority and available time.

OBJECT 'Skill':
- Name (String)
- Priority (Integer 1-5)
- TimeNeeded (Integer Minutes)
- IsCompleted (Boolean)

MAIN PROGRAM FLOW:

INITIALIZATION

Load existing data from file (if any).

Ask User: "How many minutes do you have today?" (DailyLimit)

MAIN MENU LOOP

Show options: Add Skill, Show Plan, Finish Day, Exit.

ALGORITHM: GENERATE PLAN

Create a copy of the Skills List.

SORT list by Priority (High -> Low).

IF priorities are equal, SORT by TimeNeeded (Low -> High).

LOOP through sorted list:

IF (Skill.TimeNeeded <= DailyLimit):

Add Skill to "Today's Plan".

Subtract Skill.TimeNeeded from DailyLimit.

ELSE:

Mark Skill as "Skipped" (Not enough time).

Display "Today's Plan" to user.

LOGIC: FINISH DAY (End of Day Review)

LOOP through "Today's Plan":

Ask User: "Did you complete [Skill]?"

IF (User says YES):

Check: Is CurrentPriority > OriginalPriority?

YES -> Reset Priority to Original (Reward).

NO -> Keep Priority same.

IF (User says NO):

Increase Priority by +1 (Penalty/Escalation).

(Max Priority cap could be 10).

DATA SAVING

Serialize the List of Skills to JSON format.

Write to "user_skills.json".
